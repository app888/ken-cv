    "bio": "Hi there and very welcome.\n\n I started building this page to showcase projects I would like to share - and also to learn some JavaScript in the React framework :). I am trying to explain my projects and steps I take in detail as I know how confusing it is to look at some random code snippets without description. \n\n It has been quite an excting journey for me so far transitioning from an engineering background to cloud development and DevOps, so I hope this may be helpful for other aspiring engineers intenting going into cloud as well. I personally work at the AWS Business Group of Accenture (AABG). By working in many projects and with clients I gained practical knowledge of cloud computing and coding skills that I enhanced with my engineering knowledge from my previous occupation to tackle and solve complex technical problems. Understanding the problem is oftentimes very challenging but crucial in order to start the analysis part. Only when having a clear goal in mind, developments can be turned into value and impact the outcome as well as operations. \n\n Currently I work as a FullStack Cloud Developer in Munich, Germany. I am certified in AWS, DevOps, Terraform as Infrastructure as a Code and Kubernetes as an ochestration tool for Docker. In my spare time, I enjoy working out a lot, spending a lot of time in the nature and also with the motorbike.",
